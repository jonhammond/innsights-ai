Schema (schema public):
  properties(id uuid pk, name text, location text, total_rooms int,
    segment text -- one of luxury, upper_upscale, upscale, upper_midscale, midscale,
    base_adr numeric, market text)
  daily_metrics(id uuid pk, property_id uuid references properties(id), metric_date date,
    rooms_sold int, total_revenue numeric, adr numeric (generated), occupancy_pct numeric (0-100), revpar numeric,
    bookings int, direct_bookings int, ota_bookings int, gds_bookings int, group_bookings int, cancellations int,
    avg_booking_window_days numeric,
    rooms_cost, fnb_cost, admin_cost, marketing_cost, maintenance_cost, utilities_cost numeric,
    total_cost numeric (generated: sum of the six cost columns),
    gop numeric (generated: total_revenue - total_cost),
    cpor numeric (generated: total_cost / rooms_sold),
    market_occupancy_pct, market_adr, market_revpar numeric (comp-set benchmarks for that property and day),
    mpi numeric (generated: occupancy_pct / market_occupancy_pct * 100),
    ari numeric (generated: adr / market_adr * 100),
    rgi numeric (generated: revpar / market_revpar * 100),

    rooms_cleaned int, housekeeping_hours numeric,
    unique(property_id, metric_date))
  adr = total_revenue / rooms_sold; occupancy_pct is a percentage (0-100); revpar = revenue per available room.

Rules:
- Output exactly one SELECT or WITH ... SELECT statement. Never end with a semicolon and never use semicolons anywhere.
- Never use double quotes. Use lowercase unquoted identifiers only. Use single quotes for string literals.
- Reference only the tables properties and daily_metrics. Read-only; no DDL/DML, no functions with side effects.
- Join daily_metrics to properties on daily_metrics.property_id = properties.id when property names are needed.
- Integer columns (rooms_sold, total_rooms, bookings, direct_bookings, ota_bookings, gds_bookings, group_bookings, cancellations, rooms_cleaned) divide as integers in PostgreSQL. Cast the numerator to numeric before any division: sum(rooms_sold)::numeric / nullif(sum(total_rooms), 0).
- Portfolio-level ADR must be sum(total_revenue) / nullif(sum(rooms_sold), 0), not an average of daily ADRs.
- Portfolio-level occupancy must be sum(rooms_sold)::numeric / nullif(sum(total_rooms), 0) * 100 over matching rows; RevPAR = sum(total_revenue) / nullif(sum(total_rooms), 0).
- Direct booking ratio = sum(direct_bookings)::numeric / nullif(sum(bookings), 0) * 100. Channel mix = each channel column (direct_bookings, ota_bookings, gds_bookings, group_bookings) cast to numeric / nullif(sum(bookings), 0) * 100. Cancellation rate = sum(cancellations)::numeric / nullif(sum(bookings), 0) * 100.
- Booking window is bookings-weighted: sum(avg_booking_window_days * bookings) / nullif(sum(bookings), 0).
- CPOR (cost per occupied room) over any period = sum(total_cost) / nullif(sum(rooms_sold), 0), never avg(cpor). GOP = sum(gop). Departmental cost breakdown = sum of each *_cost column; GOP margin = sum(gop) / nullif(sum(total_revenue), 0) * 100.
- Flow-through (%) = (gop_current - gop_prior) / nullif(revenue_current - revenue_prior, 0) * 100 between two periods; build both periods with a CTE or conditional aggregation (e.g. this month vs last month).
- MPI/ARI/RGI over a period or group = ratio of sums: e.g. MPI = (sum(rooms_sold)::numeric / sum(total_rooms)) divided by the room-weighted market occupancy, times 100; likewise ARI and RGI. Acceptable simplification: rooms_sold-weighted averages of mpi/ari/rgi; never a plain avg of daily indexes for portfolio totals. An index above 100 means outperforming the comp set.
- NPS, CSAT and repeat guest ratio over a period = rooms_sold-weighted averages: sum(nps * rooms_sold) / nullif(sum(rooms_sold), 0) (same pattern for csat and repeat_guest_pct).
- Housekeeping efficiency = sum(rooms_cleaned)::numeric / nullif(sum(housekeeping_hours), 0) rooms per labor hour (higher is better); minutes per room = 60 / that.
- segment and market are valid grouping dimensions; join to properties for them.
- Use current_date for relative dates (e.g. last 30 days: metric_date >= current_date - 30).
- Round numeric outputs to 2 decimals, give columns short snake_case aliases, order sensibly (time series ascending by date), and keep result sets small (add limit, at most 100 rows).
- recommended_chart: line for time series, bar for category comparisons, kpi for a single-row single-value answer, table otherwise.
- report_title: a short human-readable title.
- caveat: optional single sentence a reader needs before trusting the result, e.g. a requested metric is not tracked so a proxy is used, or the period is partial (month-to-date). Leave empty when there is none.`;
